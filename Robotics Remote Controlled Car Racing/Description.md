# 🏎️ Remote-Controlled Race Car Project

## Overview

Worked in a team of four to design and build a **remote-controlled race car**, competing in a student-organized speed race—where our entry finished **3rd place**.  
The project involved Python programming and applying **aerodynamic principles** to optimize speed and maneuverability.

---

## 🛠️ Teamwork & Role

- Collaborated closely with three teammates to engineer a competitive remote vehicle  
- Defined roles included chassis design, control logic, aerodynamics research, and programming

---

## 🔍 Technical Approach

- Used **Python** for control logic, telemetry parsing, and speed tuning  
- Researched airflow dynamics to improve drag reduction and steering response  
- Implemented performance tweaks iteratively during the build and testing cycles

---

## 🏁 Results and Performance

- Placed **3rd** in a speed race event against multiple student teams  
- Enhanced top speed and handling through careful balance of weight, drag, and drive control
